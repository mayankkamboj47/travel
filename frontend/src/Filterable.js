/**
 *
 * Filters =
 * toggles : {
 *   'kitchen' : [kitchen, setKitchen],
 *   '....   ' : [...]
 * },
 *
 *
 * We don't want to generate so many state variables. Can we have a central filtered state
 * from where they all get their stuff ?
 *
 * Reasons not to : Because that sounds complicated to think about.
 *
 * We have a uppercase, lowercase and string sensitive issue too, how to deal with that.
 *
 *
 * We need a whole object called toggles as state.
 * The UI indicates that, and the way we are making our calls indicates that.
 * We can also then manufacture toggles solely based on the data we have.
 *
 * Issue with manufacturing toggles based on the data :
 *   1. Which data are we talking about ? The one we get after the filters,
 * will be limited in what toggles and filters it gives us.
 *   The server will have to tell us therefore, but regardless, this is a good feature.
