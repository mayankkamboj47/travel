Make a portal and use that to display a login and signup modal
  - Use frosted glass effect in the modal
On the backend, try to make it so that PUT, POST work when used with passport

Make the hotelpage and other pages responsive (done)
Make the images on the homepage optimised

Testing : 

1. The homepage should 
   a. Have a hero, an about and a footer
   b. The hero should, have a button and some text. The button should be
   clickable and send you to a different page with some url. Ideally, it
   should have a href value in the containing anchor
   c. There should be a link to github
   d. There should be a link to my website
   e. Later (test on linux) : there should be no errors in eslint


2. The hotelpage should
   Have a title, some images, and text. 
   A book hotel option : 
   	. It should allow you to select stuff and book a hotel
	  On booking a hotel, we should see a "booked" dialog box, which
	  we must be able to cancel. On clicking the book button, it should
	  change to a spinner and then to either "book" again with an error
	  or to "booked"
	     - How do I test two different scenarios ? 
   On clicking a place, only hotels from that place should show up. 
   A probabilistic test : The first and the second pages should have only
   hotels from that place
   
   Hotel search list : 
   On clicking kitchen, all the hotels contain "Kitchen" in their list
   On picking a range for the price, we get hotels within that price range
   On selecting 'Kitchen', clicking a hotel, and then clicking the 'back'
   button, we should still have the kitchen filter set.
   Another way : We could add a details option to the card itself, which shows
   the entire hotel information in a popup with a blurry pretty background. 
   This modal should first be responsive and only then pretty. It should have
   a cross button to click on. Also a good chance to learn portals.
