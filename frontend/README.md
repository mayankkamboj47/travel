# eTravel project

Just another eTravel Project

## Setting up the app

Just clone the git repository, and run `npm install` or `yarn install` in both the frontend and backend folders. Now, also run npm start in both the folders (you will
need two different terminal windows/tabs probably).

## Notes

The frontend starts on 'http://localhost:3000' and the backend sits on 'http://localhost:3001' for now. 

## Running the tests

Get cypress (https://www.cypress.io). When you've run the frontend and backend servers, you can manually load the test files in frontend/cypress in cypress, and the tests will run. After the initial setup is done, the tests will re-run themselves when the files update.
